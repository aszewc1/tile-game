This repository contains the all the files relating to a tiling game created
by Alexandra Szewc. The `main` and `includes` directories contain all files
necessary to host the tile website. The `example` directory can be safely
ignored, as it contains an `old version` of the tile site as well as some code
used as an example for building this website. Finally, the `display` folder
contains some reduced code that can be used to generate pdfs of all the tiles
as well as zip files with all the tiles in each set using the jszip library.
