                    <p>
                      We begin with a set of square tiles with markings on each of the four sides.
                      Due to various reasons (relating to how these were developed), the tiles and their markings are of the kind shown in the Appendix (we shall call tiles exhibited thus to be in the Robinson format, after a logician with that name).
                      One may see that there are various tiles with various markings.
                      Henceforth, we shall call each of these tiles "prototiles" because in the game we will develop, the player has access to an "infinite" (meaning of course as many as needed) copies of each of these prototiles.
                      <br><br>
                      There will be two kinds of prototile sets, which we call "Hanf" and "Jockusch" which are names of a couple of other logicians.
                      <br><br>
                      The Hanf is the smaller set, so let us begin with the Jockusch.
                      The number of prototiles in the Jockusch set is exactly 211.
                      This, however, is not as important as the number of different markings.
                      These turn out to be just 54.
                      These have to be clearly marked on a prototile.
                      The simplest solution might be, for example, taking the first 14 letters (in capitals for example) of the English alphabet (A -- N ) and 4 distinguishable colors as shown below.
                      Also, the tiles have to be placed in a particular orientation, indicated by the arrow, not to be rotated nor flipped in any direction.
                      (This is also why the tiles need not be square: the placement does not respect the 90 degree rotational symmetries of a square.)
                      If this seems like a good solution then all we need is to create a 4 (colors) X 14  (or however many letters as needed) table, and populate them with the tile markings.
                      For example, as seen further below, some of the markings on the tile sides are 0, R25, 1R0 with an upward arrow, (R1) — R1 with parantheses -- and so on.
                      We may use markings as shown above.
                      Thus red A is one marking, blue B another and so on.
                      Since 14 X 4 = 56, we have more than enough to mark all the 54 markings involved.
                      (We could also take 13 letters, and make up the two remaining edge markings separately, say as black and white.)
                      <br><br>
                      The Hanf tile set is similar but has exactly 132 prototiles with exactly 34 distinct markings.
                      Thus if we stick with 4 colors, just the first 9 letters of the alphabet (A – I) will do.
                      Then, given the prototile set as illustrated in the next page (there will be several such pages for all of the prototiles), we can create an isomorphic prototile set by table lookup so we have a prototile set where each tile maybe looks like what is above.
                      Perhaps other more aesthetic markings may occur to one.
                      The above suggestion is only that, and not a requirement.
                      The requirement is that 54 or 34 (depending on which tile set is in question) distinct markings should be clearly visible on the sides of the squares.
                      Henceforth, we may refer to the color/letter combination that designates a side simply as a "color".
